# Research:
- Scheduller
- Transactional(rollback etc)

main focus :
- Formatting csv file and pdf file

* Notes to myself: on our planing and review our discussion always 
lil bit out of topic
we should focus on our mvp, we can discus about the future of this application 
later
when client start to tell about the algorithm, note the idea, 
and tell them to back to our main focus

after all requirement for the mvp is clear, we can start to discuss the algorithm
remember to notes every client want on api-planing

use office our for working this project, use our free time to explore about architecture and ts(web dev simplified solid)
